# EMC-NorCal-SE-AlexaChallenge-2016
Code and design docs for Alexa Challenge

The intention of this app is to be able to query EMC install base information
from the Amazon Alexa API

Example:
Input: "Alexa, what customers are in my install base?"
Output: "The following customers are in your install base: CDPH, LDC, CHP, DMV, FTB,...."

Input: "What installed at CDPH?"
Output: "CDPH has the following hardware installed: 3 VNX5600s, 3 XtremIO, 2 DataDomain 4500s', etc..."

Input: "What are the serial numbers of CDPH's XtremIO's?"
Output: "XtremIO serial numbers: FM123456, FM987543, FM45678"

These are just a few examples. More will be written here with actual usage.
